Components are a composition of elements, with scoped custom styles and can have client-side interactivity baked in with JavaScript if needed.

- Use show/hide components such as Tabs/Accordions, as a last resort.
- Isolate styles
- Provide a style customization interface
- Remove component DOM from global scope
- Enable progressive enhancement
