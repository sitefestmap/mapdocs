            <p>Map Docs - WIP: Will add more content over next weeks.</p>
            <p>Ideas / Todo 2024:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New studio data. </li>
                <li>Slides on Marker click ?</li> 
                <li>Duplicate Map section for Iframe Embedding on main site?</li> 
                <li>Single Page App ?</li>
                <li>Frameworks ? ( There are some Solid JS examples on various pages ).</li> 
            </ul>
            <p> Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colour is spelled 'Color' in the docs as that's what we have to use in CSS and I'm too lazy to expend the tiny amount of brain power required to switch between the two.</li>
                <li>There is some inconsistency in variable naming between camelCase and snake_case. I prefer snake_case but don't mind not using it in this project.</li> 
            </ul>
